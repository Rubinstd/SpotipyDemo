# SpotipyDemo

Testing the spotipy python API

## Notes before using
The spotipy API must be installed. This can be done through a variety of ways, ask me to let me know how you're doing it.

The terminal command for this is (using the pip package installer): 
pip install spotipy 

But you might not want to download it this way, just let me know how you're doing this.

The client_credintials manager uses a client_id and client_secret string. If you go to:
https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login 

You can log in with a spotify account (I guess just make an account for this project) it will let you register your project and once you do, you can get your client_id and client_secret codes and paste them here.
